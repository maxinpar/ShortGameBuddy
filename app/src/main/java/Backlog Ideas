Add the Putting games / drills that Ken Druce told us about:
    - Either 9 holes or 18 holes:
        - 6x short putts (3-4m)
        - 6x medium putts (10-12m)
        - 6x long putts (18+)
    - Scoring:
        - 3pts if you hole it
        - -3pt if you 3 putt
        - 0 pts if you 2-putt after leaving your first putt more than a putter-length outside the hole
        - 1 pt if you 2-putt after leaving the first putt within 1 putter length from the hole
